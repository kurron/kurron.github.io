                I'm a software engineer with experience in JVM-based
                microservice development operating in AWS and Docker.  I enjoy architecting
                solutions based on JVM languages, leveraging tools from the
                Spring portfolio.  Mentoring others on cloud concepts and
                introducing new software engineering techniques is something else I
                enjoy.

                        <p class="experience">Designed and implemented an asset management pipeline written in Java and deployed to Amazon ECS. AWS Lambda, SQS/SNS, DynamoDB, S3, Rekognition, CloudWatch, Elasticsearch and Snowflake were used to analyze and process the assets. Shopping site used the service, requiring low latency responses.
                            Infrastructure was managed via Terraform, with test environments getting created and destroyed on-demand. AWS CloudFormation was initially trialed but the enterprise wanted to settle on something more portable.
                            On-premises projects were written in Java using Spring Boot as well as Spring Batch, Spring for Apache Pulsar, Spring Data JPA, Spring Data JDBC and Spring Vault,S with deployments to Kubernetes. Applications provided loyalty services to the shopping site, requiring low latency responses.
                            Designed and implemented nightly batch processing systems, handling loyalty transactions from partners, using Spring Batch. Files were transferred via SFTP and processed, with a reconciliation report transferred back to the partner.
                            On-premises applications used a combination of Oracle and PostgreSQL as persistent storage, accessed primarily via Spring Data JPA and Spring Data JDBC. Distributed caching was typically handled using Spring Data Redis.
                            Responsible for the design and maintenance of REST APIs for synchronous processing and JSON messages for asynchronous processing, targeting Apache Pulsar.
                            Testing was done using JUnit5, Spring and Cucumber, with reports going to the financial overwatch team for deployment approval.</p>

                            Focusing on combining Amazon EC2 Container Service with a CI/CD pipeline. Helped design and
                            implement JVM-based solutions that leveraged a variety of forward-thinking
                            technologies, including Docker, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Spring, REST and Hibernate. Worked on a reporting
                            system the was faster and more accurate than its predecessor by utilizing event sourcing and Groovy. Fostered
                            the switch to microservices-based solutions requiring experience in Docker, Consul and Terraform. Helped
                            to incubate the continuous delivery process through prototyping and design of the tool chain. Stressed
                            test-first coding style along with automated code inspection to maintain high code quality.
                            Promoted the use of virtualization, including development environments which streamlined the on-boarding
                            process. Was part of a small team that wrote internal tools based on Flex and ActionScript.</p>

                            Focused on
                            EJB-based services and refactoring some of the code base to be more testable. Mentored some of the team
                            in unit and integration testing techniques including usage of TestNG, mockito and dependency injection.
                            Was part of an exploratory project that was tasked with creating a Java based platform for scheduling
                            and running batch processes. The solution was based on Spring, Spring Batch, Spring MVC, Quartz,
                            Terracotta and Hibernate. Proved that assembling off-the-shelf components was more cost effective than
                            creating an entire solution from scratch. In an effort to improve development efficiency, created a
                            development tool set that stressed integration between the various tools and automation. The solution
                            included Subversion, Trac, Hudson, Ant and Groovy. The resulting build system improved consistency and
                            reduced code complexity and defects, primarily due to the automated inspection tools that ran as part of
                            the build. </p>
