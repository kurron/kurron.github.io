            <p class="title">Principal Software Engineer</p>
            <p>helped design and implement JVM-based solutions that leveraged a variety of forward thinking
                technologies, including Gradle, RabbitMQ, Spring Integration, Spring Data, Spring Flex, Spring Security,
                Hibernate and MongoDB. The solutions supported both Adobe Flash clients as well as RESTful ones. Helped
                to incubate the continuous delivery process through prototyping and design of the tool chain. Stressed
                test-first coding style along with automated code inspection to maintain high code quality. Was part of
                a small team that wrote internal tools based on Flex and ActionScript.</p>

        <div class="summary">
            <p class="title">Principal Software Engineer</p>
            <p>helped design and implement an in-house banking system based on IBM WebSphere and DB2. Focused on
                EJB-based services and refactoring some of the code base to be more testable. Mentored some of the team
                in unit and integration testing techniques including usage of TestNG, mockito and dependency injection.
                Was part of an exploratory project that was tasked with creating a Java based platform for scheduling
                and running batch processes. The solution was based on Spring, Spring Batch, Spring MVC, Quartz,
                Terracotta and Hibernate. Proved that assembling off-the-shelf components was more cost effective than
                creating an entire solution from scratch. In an effort to improve development efficiency, created a
                development tool set that stressed integration between the various tools and automation. The solution
                included Subversion, Trac, Hudson, Ant and Groovy. The resulting build system improved consistency and
                reduced code complexity and defects, primarily due to the automated inspection tools that ran as part of
                the build. </p>

        <div class="summary">
            <p class="title">Principal Software Engineer</p>
            <p>helped design and implement the core of a J2EE-based OSS package for the telecommunications industry
                which has been shipped to over 60 customers, including high-transaction tier-one accounts. Relevant
                technologies included EJB, JDBC, JMS,Spring, Spring Web Services and Hibernate. Was responsible for
                design and implementation of automated element discovery and element provisioning, which required an
                understanding of graph theory, sound object-oriented design principals and testing procedures. Use of
                Design Patterns and automated test tools helped to simplify designs and minimize defects. Also helped
                create to create a WSDL-based web services hosting and consumption layer which utilized test-first
                design techniques to ensure high quality. System ran under BEA Weblogic and IBM WebSphere application
                servers talking to an Oracle database. Development was done under both Linux and Windows XP for
                deployment to Solaris and HP-UX. Was responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal project
                website to facilitate better information dispersal. Also introduced technologies into the project such
                as Spring, Log4J, ANT, CruiseControl, JUnit and Anthill. Have also been evaluating the applicability of
                Terracotta, OSGi, Maven, Java WebStart, Gradle and JBoss for use in future versions of the product</p>

        <div class="summary">
            <p class="title">Senior Java Engineer</p>
            <p>designed and implemented application server core for E-Business and E-Commerce product line. Project
                technologies included EJBs, Servlets, JMS, XML and Java Reflection APIs. Initial server was based on
                BEA's Weblogic server but design allowed for using other vendor's J2EE implementations. Initial
                implementation required knowledge of how the Java APIs were supposed to work and understanding the
                limitations of the Weblogic implementation. Guided a small team of engineers in the implementation of
                the server core. Development was done on PCs running Linux but deployment was done on Solaris.
                Participated in the porting effort to move the product over to IBM's WebSphere application server.</p>
