                        <p class="experience">helped design and implement an in-house banking system based on IBM WebSphere and DB2.
                            Focused on
                            EJB-based services and refactoring some of the code base to be more testable. Mentored some of the team
                            in unit and integration testing techniques including usage of TestNG, mockito and dependency injection.
                            Was part of an exploratory project that was tasked with creating a Java based platform for scheduling
                            and running batch processes. The solution was based on Spring, Spring Batch, Spring MVC, Quartz,
                            Terracotta and Hibernate. Proved that assembling off-the-shelf components was more cost effective than
                            creating an entire solution from scratch. In an effort to improve development efficiency, created a
                            development tool set that stressed integration between the various tools and automation. The solution
                            included Subversion, Trac, Hudson, Ant and Groovy. The resulting build system improved consistency and
                            reduced code complexity and defects, primarily due to the automated inspection tools that ran as part of
                            the build. </p>

                            technologies included EJB, JDBC, JMS,Spring, Spring Web Services and Hibernate. Was responsible for
                            design and implementation of automated element discovery and element provisioning, which required an
                            understanding of graph theory, sound object-oriented design principals and testing procedures. Use of
                            Design Patterns and automated test tools helped to simplify designs and minimize defects. Also helped
                            create to create a WSDL-based web services hosting and consumption layer which utilized test-first
                            design techniques to ensure high quality. System ran under BEA Weblogic and IBM WebSphere application
                            servers talking to an Oracle database. Development was done under both Linux and Windows XP for

                            website to facilitate better information dispersal. Also introduced technologies into the project such
                            as Spring, Log4J, ANT, CruiseControl, JUnit and Anthill. Have also been evaluating the applicability of

                            implementation required knowledge of how the Java APIs were supposed to work and understanding the
