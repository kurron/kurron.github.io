                I'm a software engineer with experience in JVM-based
                microservice development operating in AWS and Docker.  I enjoy architecting
                solutions based on JVM languages, leveraging tools from the
                Spring portfolio.  Mentoring others on cloud concepts and
                introducing new software engineering techniques is something else I
                enjoy.

                            Focused on
                            EJB-based services and refactoring some of the code base to be more testable. Mentored some of the team
                            in unit and integration testing techniques including usage of TestNG, mockito and dependency injection.
                            Was part of an exploratory project that was tasked with creating a Java based platform for scheduling
                            and running batch processes. The solution was based on Spring, Spring Batch, Spring MVC, Quartz,
                            Terracotta and Hibernate. Proved that assembling off-the-shelf components was more cost effective than
                            creating an entire solution from scratch. In an effort to improve development efficiency, created a
                            development tool set that stressed integration between the various tools and automation. The solution
                            included Subversion, Trac, Hudson, Ant and Groovy. The resulting build system improved consistency and
                            reduced code complexity and defects, primarily due to the automated inspection tools that ran as part of
                            the build. </p>
