                I'm a software engineer with experience in JVM-based
                microservice development operating in AWS and Docker.  I enjoy architecting
                solutions based on JVM languages, leveraging tools from the
                Spring portfolio.  Mentoring others on cloud concepts and
                introducing new software engineering techniques is something else I
                enjoy.
